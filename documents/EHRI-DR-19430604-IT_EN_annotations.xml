				<p>Berlin, 4th June 1943</p>
				<p>Re: Situation in the General Governorate</p>
				<p>Ref.: My Cable No. 8190/1374 of 28th May last</p>
				<p>The Inspector of the Fasci in Germany, who has returned from a brief visit to Warsaw, has sent me the following report on the
					situation in the Generalgouvernement General Governorate:</p>
				<p>“After the latest air-raids by the Bolsheviks, the town appears very much damaged. It is estimated that the German bombings, when
					Warsaw was conquered, damaged 15-20% of the buildings, and the damage inflicted by the Bolsheviks is estimated to be the same.
					This means that 30-40% of the buildings are almost totally destroyed, every couple of hundred meters one comes upon large open
					spaces covered with rubble. […]</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19430604-IT_02.jpg" n="2"/>
				<p>In the ghetto, a vast area right in the centre of town and separated from it only by a high wall built for this purpose, when
					German authorities requested that a few thousand Jews should be sent out to work in factories, the Jews refused to obey the order,
					saying that they had not heard again from the Jews that had previously left the ghetto, As we know, a war ensued that is still
					continuing. On the one side the Jews, of whom there are still perhaps about 15,000 and who have dug themselves in inside the
					ghetto, building underground bunkers up to thirty meters deep, powerfully armoured and equipped with heavy and light machine guns,
					who are supported and led by Bolsheviks sent from Moscow, and have huge stockpiles of food and ammunition that could last them for
					years of fighting. On the other, SS units who systematically and without needlessly endangering the lives of their soldiers
					advance from house to house, following even the sewers and the underground canals where fighting goes on, and subdue resistance.
					The Gestapo Chief told me that he expects to subdue all resistance within a few weeks.</p>
				<p>In this climate, while the population is being bombarded from the sky, mined underground by the fighting within the ghetto and by
					the ghetto’s emissaries (Communists and Jews who have managed to leave the ghetto and are hiding in town) and forced on the ground
					to rely on the black market to survive among all kinds of threats, secret organizations of Communists and Jews flourish, as well
					as others by Polish nationalists, both of which try to prepare the revolt and for the time being want to cause terror among the
					ruling group.</p>
				<p>The organizers warn the German rulers and those Poles that are believed to sympathize with them that they will be liquidated, and
					every day <pb facs="EHRI-DR-19430604-IT_03.jpg" n="3"/> there are murders taking place in circumstances worthy of a crime
					thriller. I have seen Gestapo chiefs and Nazi party leaders, always in civilian clothes, going around with their revolver at the
					ready. I have noticed that when they have to go somewhere, they resort to stratagems to mislead those who might be following them.
					[…]</p>
				<p>During my stay in Warsaw I have contacted local leaders of the General Governorate, of the Nazi party, of the Gestapo, of Russian
					and Polish circles close to the German occupying authorities. […]</p>
				<pb facs="EHRI-DR-19430604-IT_04.jpg" n="4"/>
				<p>These same people suggest that a solution might be found by transforming the struggle, which right now has taken on the character
					of an exclusively German struggle against Russia, thus endowing Stalin with a pedestal as Russia’s saviour, and having it revert,
					as the Duce had suggested, to its true essence: the struggle of Europe, led by the Axis, against Bolshevism.</p>
				<p>For this struggle one could rely on the organization of some millions of Russians who would fight even more fanatically than Axis
					troops against the Bolsheviks to free their fatherland from Bolshevism. To this Russia military organization, the armed forces of
					the Axis ought to provide the structure and, most importantly, the reserves.</p>
				<p>To make the military struggle of the Axis against Bolshevism feasible in this manner one would have to establish, as a fundamental
					prerequisite, the political conditions for the cooperation of all anti-Bolshevik Polish and Russia peoples on a political platform
					that might look like this: Russia to the Russia – Poland to the Poles, both obviously under the control of the Axis powers and
					their allies; war against Bolshevism; war against Jews; recognition of private property; a controlled freedom of trade.”</p>
